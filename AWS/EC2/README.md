# AWS EC2 Demo Project 🚀

## 🎯 Goal

Showcase a simple, production‑ready web application that can be **deployed on an Amazon EC2 instance**.  By the end, you will have a running server on AWS that the world can reach via a public URL.

## 📖 Project Definition

This repository contains a minimal web service (replace with your stack — Node.js, Python, Go, etc.) whose primary purpose is to demonstrate:

1. **Infrastructure‑as‑Code (IaC)** basics (security groups, key pairs, user‑data scripts, etc.).
2. **CI/CD** or manual deployment flow to an EC2 instance.
3. Cloud best practices such as least‑privilege IAM roles, environment variables, and basic monitoring.

Feel free to swap in your own application code — the focus is on **how** it is hosted, not what it does.

## 🏗️ What Is AWS?

**Amazon Web Services (AWS)** is Amazon’s public‑cloud platform offering more than 200 on‑demand services — from computing and storage to machine learning and IoT.  It lets you rent IT resources **pay‑as‑you‑go**, eliminating the need to buy and maintain physical servers.

### EC2 in a Nutshell

| Term                            | Meaning                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)** | Virtual servers in the AWS cloud. You choose the CPU, memory, storage, and network capacity. |
| **AMI (Amazon Machine Image)**  | A template used to launch EC2 instances — think of it as a pre‑configured OS snapshot.       |
| **Instance Type**               | Hardware spec (e.g., t3.micro) that determines vCPUs, RAM, etc.                              |
| **Security Group**              | Virtual firewall controlling inbound/outbound traffic.                                       |
| **Key Pair**                    | SSH credentials for logging in securely.                                                     |

EC2 gives you granular control similar to a VPS, but with cloud perks: **auto‑scaling**, **elastic IPs**, **snapshots**, and tight integration with the rest of AWS.
